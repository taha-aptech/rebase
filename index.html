    <pre><h1>Rebase in GIT</h1></pre>
    <pre><p>Rebase in Git is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. 
    It allows you to integrate changes from one branch into another by applying the commits one by one. 
    Unlike merging, which creates a new merge commit, rebasing results in a linear commit history.
